# MX
Currently only available to users in our alpha test program. To join, visit [www.AdClear.com](https://adclear.com/) on your Android device.

## Release Notes:
The very first version of our new product, code named MX, is ready for early alpha testing. Inside MX, the goal is to run your favorite apps ad-free.  

In this first release, many aspects are still broken, and we appreciate your patience and help. Only the following apps are on our target list for this release: 

- YouTube (on Android 9 and 10) 
- Facebook (on Android 9 only) 

To add an app to MX, tap (+) in the lower right corner and choose the apps to install. 

We’d especially appreciate feedback and test mileage for YouTube and Facebook: reporting any misbehavior in these either through “Send Feedback” or in this Google Groups is most appreciated. Issues observed on all other apps are interesting as well, but many of them we are aware of and are working hard to resolve. 

Currently known issues: 

- Facebook crashes on Android 6, 7, 8, and 10 
- No apps run on Android 11 
- YouTube ads on Android 7 and 8 
- After adding an app, it may take a long time before apps like YouTube and Facebook appear in MX home screen and no progress indicator is shown 
- First launch of YouTube may take a long time and no progress indicator is shown 
- Closing MX requires navigating to Settings > Apps > MX > Force stop 
- Many apps – mainly games – with 32-bit libraries may crash on 64-bit devices
